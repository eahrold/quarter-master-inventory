# Quarter Master Inventory App - Task List

## Development Strategy: Frontend-Backend Parity

**All features must be developed in pairs - backend API + frontend UI together.**
Each feature is complete only when both backend and frontend implementations are done, tested, and integrated.

## High Priority (Core Foundation)

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

- [x] **Setup Project Structure** - Set up project structure with monorepo (frontend, backend, shared packages)
- [x] **Setup Database** - Configure Drizzle ORM with SQLite and create database schema (troops, users, items, transactions)
- [x] **Setup Backend Core** - Set up Hono server with TypeScript, middleware, and basic routing structure
- [x] **Setup Frontend Core** - Set up React app with Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components
- [x] **Fix Navigation Layout** - Fix broken sidebar navigation layout with overlapping user profile section
- [x] **Implement Backend Auth System** - JWT authentication with role-based access control (Admin/Leader/Scout/Viewer)
- [x] **Setup Comprehensive Testing** - Set up comprehensive testing framework with Vitest, created auth middleware tests (100% coverage), multi-tenant database tests, and JWT validation tests

### üîÑ In Progress

## Task Completion Guidelines

- ‚úÖ **Completed**: Task is fully implemented and tested
- üîÑ **In Progress**: Currently working on this task
- ‚è≥ **Pending**: Not yet started

### Testing Requirements for All Tasks

**Every feature implementation must include comprehensive tests:**

#### Backend Features Must Include:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and middleware (minimum 85% coverage)
- **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints with authentication and authorization
- **Database Tests**: Test multi-tenant data isolation and constraints
- **Security Tests**: Test for vulnerabilities and access control
- **Error Handling Tests**: Test error scenarios and edge cases

#### Frontend Features Must Include:

- **Component Tests**: Test component rendering and interactions
- **Hook Tests**: Test custom hooks with various scenarios
- **Integration Tests**: Test component integration with API calls
- **User Interaction Tests**: Test user workflows and form submissions

#### Coverage Requirements:

- **Authentication & Authorization**: 100% statement coverage
- **Business Logic**: 90% statement coverage
- **API Endpoints**: 85% statement coverage
- **Database Operations**: 85% statement coverage
- **Overall Project**: 85% minimum statement coverage

### Feature Pair Development Workflow

1. **Plan Feature Pair**: Define both backend API and frontend UI requirements
2. **Backend First**: Implement and test the backend API endpoints
3. **Frontend Second**: Implement the frontend UI that consumes the API
4. **Integration**: Ensure frontend and backend work together seamlessly
5. **End-to-End Testing**: Test the complete user workflow
6. **Mark Complete**: Only when both backend and frontend are done and integrated

### Individual Task Workflow

1. Mark task as "In Progress" when starting work
2. **Write tests first** (Test-Driven Development encouraged)
3. Complete the implementation
4. **Ensure all tests pass** with required coverage
5. Test the functionality manually
6. **Run full test suite** to ensure no regressions
7. Mark task as "Completed"
8. Create git commit with summary of changes
9. Move to next task in the feature pair

### Git Commit Format

Each completed task should have a commit message following this format:

```
feat: [task description]

- Brief summary of what was implemented
- Key changes made
- Any important notes

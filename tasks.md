- ‚è≥ **Pending**: Not yet started

### Testing Requirements for All Tasks

**Every feature implementation must include comprehensive tests:**

#### Backend Features Must Include:
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and middleware (minimum 85% coverage)
- **Integration Tests**: Test API endpoints with authentication and authorization
- **Database Tests**: Test multi-tenant data isolation and constraints
- **Security Tests**: Test for vulnerabilities and access control
- **Error Handling Tests**: Test error scenarios and edge cases

#### Frontend Features Must Include:
- **Component Tests**: Test component rendering and interactions
- **Hook Tests**: Test custom hooks with various scenarios
- **Integration Tests**: Test component integration with API calls
- **User Interaction Tests**: Test user workflows and form submissions

#### Coverage Requirements:

- **Business Logic**: 90% statement coverage
- **API Endpoints**: 85% statement coverage
- **Database Operations**: 85% statement coverage
- **Overall Project**: 85% minimum statement coverage

### Workflow

1. Mark task as "In Progress" when starting work
2. **Write tests first** (Test-Driven Development encouraged)
3. Complete the implementation
4. **Ensure all tests pass** with required coverage
5. Test the functionality manually
6. **Run full test suite** to ensure no regressions
7. Mark task as "Completed"
8. Create git commit with summary of changes
9. Move to next task

### Git Commit Format

Each completed task should have a commit message following this format:

```
feat: [task description]

- Brief summary of what was implemented
- Key changes made
- Any important notes

# Quarter Master Inventory App

A web-based inventory management system for scout troops to track equipment stored in trailers, with QR code-based check-in/out functionality and location-based organization.

Warning: Caveat emptor This project is an experimentation in spec coded, with minimal interaction. Primarily using Claude, but various other models were used at different points.

## Features

- **Multi-Tenant**: Complete data isolation between scout troops
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Admin, Leader, Scout, and Viewer roles
- **QR Code Integration**: Camera-based scanning for quick item access with printable labels
- **Mobile-Responsive**: Optimized for mobile devices and tablets
- **Location Tracking**: Organize items by trailer location (Left/Right, Low/Middle/High)
- **Inventory Management**: Complete CRUD operations with search and filtering
- **User Management**: Full user administration with role-based permissions
- **Transaction Logging**: Complete audit trail of all check-in/out activities (coming soon)

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for fast development and builds
- **Tailwind CSS** with yellow/orange theme
- **shadcn/ui** component library
- **React Query** for server state management
- **Zustand** for client state management

### Backend

- **Hono** TypeScript-first web framework
- **Drizzle ORM** with SQLite database
- **JWT** authentication
- **QR Code** generation and parsing

### Shared

- **TypeScript** types and validation schemas
- **Zod** runtime validation

## Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**

   ```bash
   cp packages/backend/.env.example packages/backend/.env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

3. **Initialize database**

   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   npm run db:seed
   ```

4. **Start development servers**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This starts both frontend (http://localhost:5173) and backend (http://localhost:3000)
